# sw-cor24-plsw

PL/SW (Programming Language for Software Wrighter) compiler for the
COR24 24-bit RISC ISA.

A freestanding, PL/I-inspired systems language with compile-time macro
metaprogramming and controlled inline assembly, transpiling to
human-readable COR24 assembler source (.s).

## Status

Phase 3 in progress — symbol table and type system. Phase 2 (parser/AST)
complete. Scoped symbol table with global and per-procedure scopes,
shadowing, case-insensitive lookup, and duplicate detection. Type system
with width tracking, signedness, assignment/expression compatibility
checking, pointer arithmetic rules, compound type descriptors for arrays
and records with computed field offsets.
